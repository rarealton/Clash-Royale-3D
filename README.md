# Clash Royale 3D

The semi-official 3D version of Clash Royale.
This is a work in progress, so don't expect much. Also, if there are any copyright issues, let me know and I will adress them as soon as I can.




Playable builds are downloadable here :https://goo.gl/i6S9sU

Recommended system specs: i5/AMD quad core CPU or higher, GTX 770/R9 290 or higher, and at least 4GB RAM.




<b>Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any damage to your computer resulting from intense GPU usage, since this is meant to be pretty, not fast.</b>

<i>TL;DR - 3D Clash Royale awesomeness that will burn holes through your PC hardware and may or may not bring Armageddon to the planet.</i>
